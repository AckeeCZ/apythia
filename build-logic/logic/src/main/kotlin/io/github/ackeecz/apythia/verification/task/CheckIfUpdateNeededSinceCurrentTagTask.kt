/**
 * Checks if the artifact has changed and needs to be updated (new version published) since the
 * current tag. Succeeds if the artifact is up-to-date and fails if it needs to be updated.
 *
 * This task is just a helper task and only meant for ad-hoc checks during development or when
 * preparing for release to check which artifacts changed and might need to update. It checks the
 * current artifact state against the current (latest) release tag, so running this task once the tag
 * for the new upcoming version was created is pointless, because it will always succeeds due to no
 * changes. So you should rather use this task to verify what changed and needs updates and then proceed
 * to increase appropriate artifact versions and start release process. There is a different task
 * [VerifyPublishingTask] that is able to do similar checks to this task, but takes the previous
 * tag instead of the current one, so it can handle newly created tag for the current in-progress
 * release properly.
